## Existing distributed social networks

There are many projects ongoing that tries to enable this, but I believe none of them have matured to the point that they can be considered serious contenders. I believe, in fact, that the fault lies in trying to create one system that can do it all. We need to utilize the many features that the Internet has to offer.

One lesson worth taking from the beginning of the Internet as a mainstream phenomena, is its distributed nature. A point that can be derived from the answer a supervisor in InterNIC gave, when [prompted by a Wired journalist whether or not he could register mcdonalds.com](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/mcdonalds_pr.html) for himself:

> "There is nothing that says I can stop you from doing that," he said. "We really need some policy."
> 
> "The problem with the Internet is, who's in charge?" he added wryly. "When we figure that out, there will be a meeting."

Another feature that should be utilized is the many standards that are available. If you're going to have larger groups of people collaborate, then you need to have standards they can agree on. A set of standards that I believe is ripe for use in the distributed social networks, is many of those collectively known through their umbrella [The Semantic Web (SW)](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/).

Most important amongst these is [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](http://www.w3.org/RDF/), which lays the foundations for exchanging information through graphs. There are also formats like [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) that allows for RDF to be exchanged in an easy-to-read manner for developers.
