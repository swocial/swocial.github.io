<p>A little bit of writing...</p>
<h2 id="existing-distributed-social-networks">Existing distributed social networks</h2>
<p>There are many projects ongoing that tries to enable this, but I believe none of them have matured to the point that they can be considered serious contenders. I believe, in fact, that the fault lies in trying to create one system that can do it all. We need to utilize the many features that the Internet has to offer.</p>
<p>One lesson worth taking from the beginning of the Internet as a mainstream phenomena, is its distributed nature. A point that can be derived from the answer a supervisor in InterNIC gave, when <a href="http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/mcdonalds_pr.html">prompted by a Wired journalist whether or not he could register mcdonalds.com</a> for himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is nothing that says I can stop you from doing that,&quot; he said. &quot;We really need some policy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The problem with the Internet is, who&#39;s in charge?&quot; he added wryly. &quot;When we figure that out, there will be a meeting.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another feature that should be utilized is the many standards that are available. If you&#39;re going to have larger groups of people collaborate, then you need to have standards they can agree on. A set of standards that I believe is ripe for use in the distributed social networks, is many of those collectively known through their umbrella <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">The Semantic Web (SW)</a>.</p>
<p>Most important amongst these is <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a>, which lays the foundations for exchanging information through graphs. There are also formats like <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> that allows for RDF to be exchanged in an easy-to-read manner for developers.</p>
