<p>This book will explore the possibilities of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network">Distributed Social Network (DSN)</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic Web (SW)</a>. It will explain the different concepts involved, discuss the challenges entailed, and propose some ideas for solutions that might be applicable. Hopefully this text can be a contribution to the many projects already out there (which also will be discussed), and maybe trigger some new contributions as well.</p>
<h2 id="who-the-book-is-for">Who the book is for</h2>
<h3 id="the-users">The Users</h3>
<p>We as users of social networks, consumers and producers as we are interchangeably, need to position ourselves into positions of power.</p>
<p><strong>As citizens of social networks we want:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To own the data of which we are the producers<ul>
<li>To administrate this information in a way that isn&#39;t time-consuming or in other way burdensome to our lives and resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To make use of this data as we wish, which entails<ul>
<li>To exchange parts with our friends</li>
<li>To broadcast parts with our followers</li>
<li>To allow service providers access, so that they can make use of it in some way that benefits us</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To receive updates from our friends<ul>
<li>Information that we can consume and utilize as we wish</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To the extent possible know what has been distributed, and to who</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-service-providers">The Service Providers</h3>
<p>There are limitations to what can be accomplished by users alone. For a distributed social network to be possible, it needs to make use of a distributed network already in place, e.g. the Internet. In addition to this structural requirement, there also a need for service providers. And we must acknowledge that these providers are part of an economic system that requires them to turn in profit. Service providers need to be an integrated part of the system, and their needs should also be fulfilled (as long as they aren&#39;t in conflict with that of the users).</p>
<p><strong>A service provider should be able:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To develop and maintain a service without being required to offer full transparency (e.g. allowed to own and use proprietary code)</li>
<li>To utilize the service in a way that enables them to continue the service (e.g. make profit)</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time a service is dependent on trust from its users, as they grant access to the data that can be processed. The mechanisms in play should make use of this, so that users can ensure that a service provider doesn&#39;t abuse the trust its given, e.g. by violating the statements of use of data.</p>
<h3 id="the-environment">The Environment</h3>
<h2 id="other-projects">Other projects</h2>
<p>There are many projects ongoing that tries to enable this, but I believe none of them have matured to the point that they can be considered serious contenders. I believe, in fact, that the fault lies in trying to create one system that can do it all. We need to utilize the many features that the Internet has to offer.</p>
<p>One lesson worth taking from the beginning of the Internet as a mainstream phenomena, is its distributed nature. A point that can be derived from the answer a supervisor in InterNIC gave, when <a href="http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/mcdonalds_pr.html">prompted by a Wired journalist whether or not he could register mcdonalds.com</a> for himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is nothing that says I can stop you from doing that,&quot; he said. &quot;We really need some policy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The problem with the Internet is, who&#39;s in charge?&quot; he added wryly. &quot;When we figure that out, there will be a meeting.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another feature that should be utilized is the many standards that are available. If you&#39;re going to have larger groups of people collaborate, then you need to have standards they can agree on. A set of standards that I believe is ripe for use in the distributed social networks, is many of those collectively known through their umbrella <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">The Semantic Web (SW)</a>.</p>
<p>Most important amongst these is <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a>, which lays the foundations for exchanging information through graphs. There are also formats like <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> that allows for RDF to be exchanged in an easy-to-read manner for developers.</p>
